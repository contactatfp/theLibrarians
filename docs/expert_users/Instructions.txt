Prerequisites

Python 3 is required to run the project.

Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using 'git clone https://github.com/contactatfp/theLibrarians.git'

2. Create a virtual environment by navigating to the 'theLibrarians/dev' directory and running the command 'python3 -m venv venv' (for Linux or Mac) or 'python -m venv venv' (for Windows)

3. Activate the virtual environment by navigating to the 'theLibrarians/dev' directory and running the command 'source venv/bin/activate' (for Linux or Mac) or 'venv\Scripts\activate' (for Windows)

4. Install the required dependencies by navigating to the dev directory and running the command 'pip3 install -r requirements.txt'

5. Email kyle.Louderback@sjsu.edu for a file 'config.json' that will be placed in the 'theLibrarians/dev' directory. This will provide you access to the API key needed to generate the book and images.
Note: Any config.json older than May 4th 2023 will not work

5a. Delete instance/site.db if it has been created before May 4th 2023

6. In the same directory, start the database server by running the command 'python app.py'

7. You are now ready to use the Flask app. In your web browser, navigate to http://127.0.0.1:80
 to view the home page. From there, you can navigate to the other pages of the app, create an account, and generate a children's book based on your input.

8. To deactivate the virtual environment, run the command 'deactivate'

9. To delete the virtual environment, run the command 'rm -rf venv' (for Linux or Mac) or 'rmdir /s venv' (for Windows)

FAQ/Troubleshooting

1. I'm getting an error like "sqlite3.OperationalError: no such column: post.image"!
Solution: Your database file is outdated and needs to be rebuilt. Close flask if it is running, then delete 'site.db' under theLibrarians\dev\instance.

2. I'm getting an error that I'm missing a Python module!
Solution: The required modules might have changed in the newest build. Try running pip to install the requirements again. While in the directory 'theLibrarians\dev\' run the command 'pip3 install -r requirements.txt'.

3. I'm getting an error like "FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'config.json'"!
Solution: You are missing our config file with private keys. Email kyle.Louderback@sjsu.edu for a file 'config.json' that will be placed in the 'theLibrarians/dev' directory.

4. I have the 'config.json' file in the 'theLibrarians/dev' directory but I'm getting an error like "KeyError: 'image_connection_string'"!
Solution: Your config file you have is outdated and will no longer work. Email kyle.Louderback@sjsu.edu for a new 'config.json' file that will be placed in the 'theLibrarians/dev' directory.
